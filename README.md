Some of my work from projects.
Scripts/Software produced for a project cannot be added as its restricted.
Detailed studies cannot be added as they are restricted.

#### Functional Monitoring
The brief was to put in place a way to functionally monitor our systems, and i played a major part in designing and rolling it out.
There were competing ideologies, and there was much I had to sift through, evaluate, many people to convince, many options to rule out – before we developed an extensible framework which involved pushing basic transactional data to Elasticsearch, and then visualised it via Kibana.

As part of my work in implementing Functional Monitoring in the company, i trained many people who were in different roles.  
This has the Kibana 3 cheatsheet i produced to reflect the training, and also instructions around a local installation.
Detailed studies and postmortems of existing solutions within the company are confidential and I am unable to share them.

#### Assessment approach
The excel "My Design Approach" lists some aspects i go through in my mind when i am approached for an assessment or to contribute to a design, or simply when i read designs from other members to learn. It lists my rough approach, and a lot can vary based on my current functional and technical knowhow of the products & stacks i have worked on.
